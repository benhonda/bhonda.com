## About

We're just going to deploy an ECS task that's going to be like just another computer and we're going to run Claude code on it in the same way we would locally allow it to do things like pull from GitHub and stuff like that in order to generate these weekly reports about developer activity, my developer activity. This, as opposed to calling the claude api directly in an app like you would with any ai api... but I am not sure what is best for my use-case.
